## Engineering Identity

I am a thinking engineer.

I do not optimize for writing more code.  
I optimize for reducing unnecessary complexity.

My work centers on one question:

> How can we design systems that remain deterministic, evolvable, and efficient — even as business logic grows?

---

## Core Methodology

### Step 1 — Establish Deterministic Data Flow (0 → 1)

Before elegance.
Before abstraction.
Before scalability.

First, make the data flow reliable.

Even if the solution is rough.  
Even if the structure is temporary.

A system must first become *predictable*.

> Determinism is the foundation of architecture.

---

### Step 2 — Engineer for Sustainability (1 → 10)

Once information flows with certainty:

- Extract stable boundaries
- Abstract business rules
- Eliminate accidental complexity
- Automate repetitive structures
- Refactor toward evolvability

From brute-force integration  
to systemized architecture.

## What I Build

### High-Abstraction API Systems

I design APIs not as CRUD endpoints,  
but as compression layers of business complexity.

An API should:

- Define responsibility boundaries
- Protect internal evolution
- Stabilize external contracts
- Control complexity propagation

---

### Automation-Driven Engineering

If something is repeated twice,  
it should become structure.

If repeated ten times,  
it should become a generator.

I focus on:

- Business rule abstraction
- Concurrency-optimized backend systems (Kotlin + Coroutines)
- API scaffolding & structural automation
- Kubernetes-native service design
- CI/CD pipelines
- Efficiency-first engineering workflows

Engineering excellence is not about volume.  
It is about leverage.

---

## System Evolution Perspective

0 → 1  
Establish reliable data connection — even brutally.

1 → 10  
Abstract, systemize, automate, stabilize.

10 → 100  
Scale with architectural confidence.

---

## AI × API

AI changes internal capability, not architectural necessity.

Traditional APIs encapsulate rule execution.  
AI-powered APIs encapsulate probabilistic cognition.

The challenge is not to add AI everywhere,  
but to design deterministic boundaries around probabilistic systems.

I am exploring:

- AI-assisted rule abstraction
- AI-augmented API generation pipelines
- Deterministic wrappers for probabilistic engines
- AI-integrated development workflows

The future of engineering is not replacing developers.

It is increasing structural leverage.

---

## Principle

Build systems that reduce human friction.  
Design boundaries that control complexity.  
Automate what should never require human attention.

## 日本語サマリー

複雑な業務ロジックを抽象化し、  
確定性のあるデータフローを構築し、  
それを体系化・自動化することを軸にしています。

0→1 の情報接続を確立し、  
1→10 の持続可能な構造へ進化させる。

AI を単なる機能追加ではなく、  
構造的レバレッジとして活用するエンジニアを目指しています。
